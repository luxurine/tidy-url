# Icons

This directory contains placeholder icon files. Replace these with proper PNG icons:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

The icon.svg file contains a basic design that can be converted to PNG using any SVG to PNG converter.

For production, create proper icons with:
- Clean, minimalist design
- Good contrast for both light and dark browser themes
- Clear representation of the "tidy URL" concept (perhaps a chain link with cleaning elements)
